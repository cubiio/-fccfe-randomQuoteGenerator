## Repo
Original development on this project in this Github [repo](https://github.com/cubiio/freeCodeCamp-frontEnd/tree/master/01-quoteGenerator). This includes development and commit history to the working version. 

I decided to restructured to a new repo to use the Github-Page to host a demo. This has the benefit to me of being able to use my own editor and workflow, and not use Codepen.
